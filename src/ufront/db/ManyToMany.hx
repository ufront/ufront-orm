// Note:
// Throughout this class, I've had to replace SPOD macro calls with the "unsafe" runtime calls.
// The reason for this is that the macro versions hardcode the table name into the query - and so
// they always use the "Relationship" table, rather than our custom table names for each join.
// In the code, I've left the macro line above the "unsafe" line, but commented out, so that
// you can see essentially what it is that we're trying to do.

// Note 2:
// On the server side, this class does all the expected database interactions.  On the client side
// it really does little more than keep a list of <B> objects.  When we send the ManyToMany object
// back to the server, the list will be sent back in-tact, so we can manipulate it, save it to the DB etc.

/**
An object used to join two tables/models with a Many-to-Many relationship.

A ManyToMany relationship is one where two models are joined but there's no obvious `BelongsTo` relationship - each object can be related to many others on each side.

Examples include:

- Blog Posts and Tags (each blog post can have many tags, each tag can have many blog posts)
- Users and Groups (each user can have many groups, each group can have many users)
- Projects and Staff (each project can have many staff assigned to it, each staff member could be assigned to one or more projects)
- Students and Classes, etc.

The join table follows the `Relationship` schema, but uses a different name for each join type.
The naming convention for join tables is `_join_$firstClass_$secondClass` where the class names are sorted alphabetically.

A current limitation is that you can only have one ManyToMany join table between each combination of models.
For example, you cannot have two properties `teachers:ManyToMany<Teacher,Class>` and `assistantTeachers:ManyToMany<Teacher,Class>` - they will both use the same join table.

The `ManyToMany` class has some static helpers for:

- `ManyToMany.generateTableName` Generating a join table name from two classes
- `ManyToMany.createJoinTable` Creating the join table in the database, if it does not exist
- `ManyToMany.relatedIDsforObjects` Getting the related IDs for a particular set of object

The `ManyToMany` object is used to find the related IDs for a particular object:

```haxe
var joins = new ManyToMany( myUser, Group );
for ( group in joins ) {
	trace( group );
}
joins.add( someNewGroup );
```

If in your models you specify a `ManyToMany` property, the build macro will automatically take care of constructing the `ManyToMany` object for you:

```haxe
// Please note the ordering of the two type parameters: you always do the current model first, the related model second.
class User {
	var groups:ManyToMany<User,Group>;
}
class Group {
	var users:ManyToMany<Group,User>;
}

function () {
	for ( group in myUser.groups ) {
		trace( '$myUser is in the group $group' );
		trace( 'The other people in that group are: '+group.users.join(", ") );
	}
}
```

Please note that on the server, SQL queries are executed immediately - if you `this.add()` a related object, it will insert the join row immediately.
This means that all of your related objects must be saved and have a valid ID before you start creating joins.

When you first create a ManyToMany object, it will fetch the list of related objects if `initialise` is true.
If you're accessing the joins through a model's `ManyToMany` property, the first time you call the getter it will fetch the list.

On the client, none of the SQL queries are executed, but the ManyToMany object can be serialized and shared between client and server.
This means you can serialize an object on the server with it's joins, and unserialize it on the client with the relationships in tact.
Making changes to the ManyToMany object on the client, such as adding another related object, will have no effect on the database.
